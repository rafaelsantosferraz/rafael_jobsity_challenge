Rafael Ferraz Jobsity interview challenge

## Working process notes
  
  The main focus is on test driven development, which is design using behavior (BDD) to fit the 
  application requirements.
  TDD process lets you focus on domain (DDD), resulting in a better design, all together with test 
  quality assurance. 
  Event driven development fits perfectly with BDD language, making it easy to link code behavior 
  with document specified behaviors. Example: 
      - document says: 'When user taps...' 
      - code run: TapEvent trigger; 


## Working process steps

- 1th: 
  git init & first commit
  
- 2th: 
  Started this documentation 
  
- 3th:
  Sketch initial domain in order to accomplish first behavior, fetch series on start and test it.
  TDD & BDD

- 4th:
  Keep sketching domain in order to accomplish second behavior, search series.
  TDD & BDD

- 5th:
  Keep sketching domain in order to accomplish third behavior, series fields.
  TDD & BDD

- 6th:
  Keep sketching domain in order to accomplish fourth behavior, episode fields.
  TDD & BDD

- 7th:
  Enough sketching, now will start structure directories with clean arch
  
- 8th:
  Start basic home Ui
  
- 9th:
  Fetch data and bind data
