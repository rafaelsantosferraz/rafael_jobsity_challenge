Rafael Ferraz Jobsity interview challenge

## Working process notes
  
  The main focus is on test driven development, using behavior (BDD) along the document with
  requirements.
  TDD process lets you focus on domain (DDD), resulting in a better design, all together with test 
  quality insurance. 
  Event driven development fits perfectly with BDD language, making it easy to link code behavior 
  with document specify behavior. Example: 
      - document says: 'When user taps...' 
      - code run: TapEvent trigger; 


## Working process steps

- First: 
  git init & first commit
  
- Second: 
  Started this documentation 
  
- Third:
  Sketch initial domain in order to accomplish first behavior, fetch series on start and test it.
  TDD & BDD

- Fourth:
  Keep sketching domain in order to accomplish second behavior, search series.
  TDD & BDD

- Fifth:
  Keep sketching domain in order to accomplish third behavior, series fields.
  TDD & BDD

- Sixth:
  Keep sketching domain in order to accomplish fourth behavior, episode fields.
